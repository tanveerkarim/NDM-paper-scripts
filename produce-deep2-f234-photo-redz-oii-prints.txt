1. Load and combine DEEP2 extended pcat files for Fields 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
File names for Fields 2, 3 and 4: pcat_ext.**.fits
Special treatment to Field 4 data.
ra,dec discrepancy: 0.002, -0.003
ra,dec discrepancy: 0.004, -0.010
Completed.

2. Mask BADFLAG==0 objects.
Completed.

3. Mask objects that lie outside DEEP2 window functions.
Completed.

4. Save the trimmed DEEP2 photometric catalogs as deep2-f**-photo-trimmed.fits.
Completed.

6. Load other catalogs.
color-selection.txt: Catalog that provides DEEP2 BRI color selection information.
     Contains object ID, RA, dec, whether the object would have been targeted if in EGS. 
     (1=yes, 0=no), and whether it would have been targeted in a non-EGS field.
     Provided by Jeff Newman
Completed.

deep2-f**-redz-oii.fits: DEEP2 redshift catalogs that John Moustakas provided.
 	Extract OBJNO, RA, DEC, OII_3727, OII_3727_ERR, ZHELIO, ZHELIO_ERR, ZQUALITY.
 	Note 1: Negative errors have the following meaning
     	-1.0 = line not detected with amplitude S/N > 1.5. Upper limit calculated.
     	-2.0 = line not measured (not in spectral range)
 	Note 2: For ZQUALITY values, see http://deep.ps.uci.edu/DR4/zquality.html.
Completed.

7. Append additional columns to the photometric catalogs from others.
7a. Append redshift catalogs.
Columns added: OBJNO_zcat, RA_zcat, DEC_zcat, OII_3727, OII_3727_ERR, RED_Z, Z_ERR, Z_QUALITY, TARG_WEIGHT
# of elements in intersection: 9336
# of elements in intersection: 11644
# of elements in intersection: 9126
f2: # in zcat minus # in pcat matched 266
f3: # in zcat minus # in pcat matched 342
f4: # in zcat minus # in pcat matched 2164
The number of overlapping objects are smaller because certain
 spectroscopic areas were masked out in previous steps (the area
 estimates above are compatible). I ignore the small number of object
 loss.
Completed.

7c. Append color-selection information.
Columns added: OBJNO_color, BRI_cut
# of elements in intersection: 101179
# of elements in intersection: 135206
# of elements in intersection: 103017
f2: # in pcat minus # in pcat matched 0
f3: # in pcat minus # in pcat matched 0
f4: # in pcat minus # in pcat matched 223
The last 223 objects will be classified as DEEP2 BRI color rejected objects.
Completed.

7d. Append Tycho2 stark mask field.
Completed.
8. Compute the class number based on the information above and append to the table.
Recall: 
cn0: Gold
cn1: Silver
cn2: NoOII
cn3: NoZ
cn4: Non-ELG
cn5: DEEP2_unobserved
Category counts 0 through 5
[ 1570  3985   817  2365 86013  6429]
[  2307   4647    836   3207 115551   8658]
[ 1643  3833   820  2328 88686  5930]
Completed.

9. Save the resulting catalogs.
Completed.

Check number of objects before and after save.
Field: Before vs. After
F2: 101179 / 101179
F3: 135206 / 135206
